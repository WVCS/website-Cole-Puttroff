<p1> The first project on the right is my Nobel Prize Winners Dataset app. This uses a list of Nobel winners and filters them based on the criteria the user inputs. This means you can find any winner from 1911 to 2016 based on different aspects. The second project in the middle is my conditional app that gives a rough estimate if you should be an engineer and what school you schould consider, whether the program thinks you should be an engineer or not. It uses things like favorite subject and ACT score to determine if you should be an engineer. Then you input a state you would like to attend college in so the program knows which college to recommend.
