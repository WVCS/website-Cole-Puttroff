  Rules of the Game </h2>
  <p1>
    <div style = "position:relative; left:20px;">
    - Globle is a country guessing game that tests your knowledge of countries around the world and where they are<br> - You have to guess countires and if the color of the country turns light on the globe, you are far from the country <br> you're supposed to guess<br> - If the color of the country is darker and the color is closer to red, then you are close to the winning country<br>- The point of the game is to guess the country in as little guesses as possible <br> - Once you guess the correct country, it will turn green and the game will end

  Stratgey to Win </h2>
<p1> 
  <div style = "position:relative; left:20px;">
  - The best strategy to winning is not guessing larger countries in the beginning. Is because they border a lot of countries. If the larger country <br> you guess turns red then you don't really know which of the many countries it borders is the right answer. <br> - Using your second and third guesses like a compass is also a good strategy. Once you make your first guess you can use your second and third guesses to see which direction the answer country is by seeing if the guess is darker or lighter than your first guess.
